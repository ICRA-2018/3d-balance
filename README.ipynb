    "- Install OpenRAVE: here are [instructions for Ubuntu 14.04](https://scaron.info/teaching/installing-openrave-on-ubuntu-14.04.html) as well as [for Ubuntu 16.04](https://scaron.info/teaching/installing-openrave-on-ubuntu-16.04.html)\n",
    "- Install Python and related dependencies: ``sudo apt-get install cython python python-dev python-pip python-scipy``\n",
    "- Install Python packages: ``sudo pip install pycddlib quadprog``\n",
    "- Install [CasADi](http://casadi.org). Pre-compiled binaries are available, but I recommend you [build it from source](https://github.com/casadi/casadi/wiki/InstallationLinux). When installing IPOPT, make sure to install the MA27 linear solver (``ThirdParty/HSL`` folder).\n",
